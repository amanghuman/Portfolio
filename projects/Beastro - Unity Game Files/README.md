This is a fantasy inspired 3D Restaurant management game with farming and PS2 platforming era combat where the player has to manage the restaurant during the weekdays and hunt, harvest, and forage during their freetime. The player will manage the restaurant by creating the menu, serving food in the style of Dinner Dash, and pay costs at the end of the work day or week, while cooking will be handled with timers (Ex: 5mins to cook a steak). With the money the player earns from the restaurant, the player can invest into improving/buying their weapons and gear, restaurant improvements, buying seeds or exotic foods. The restaurant is where the player's main hub and where the restaurant management will take place, and the player can choose to go to a new area to collect the ingredients needed for the restaurant that day, or go to the farm to work on the crops. Once the player is outside hunting they would be able to attack enemies which once defeated drop ingredients that can be used at the restaurant.  Going to sleep will also progress the day by one and save the game.
